# Market Prediction Model for Japanese cars

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the feasibility of introducing Japanese cars into the Indian market. By analyzing customer demographics and market conditions, we will determine whether the company can successfully penetrate the Indian automobile market.

## Datasets

We have two datasets for this project:

1. **Japanese Market Data**: Contains historical data from the Japanese market.
2. **Indian Market Data**: Used for testing the model's predictions regarding potential success in the Indian market.

### Dataset Features

The datasets contain the following features:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **CURR_AGE**: Current age of the customer.
- **GENDER**: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- **ANN_INCOME**: Annual income of the customer.
- **DT_MAINT**: Date of maintenance (if applicable).
- **DAYS**: Number of days since the last transaction.
- **AGE_CAR**: Age of the car being considered.

## Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the datasets for analysis.
2. **Model Training**: Use the Japanese market data to train a predictive model.
3. **Model Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance using the Indian market data.
4. **Prediction**: Generate predictions on whether the company can successfully introduce its cars in India.
